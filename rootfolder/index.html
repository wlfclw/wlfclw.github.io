        the stress of creating something new all the time. the stress of following what is trending to keep up. the stress of not wanting to be like anyone else. the stress...
        <br>
        the stress.
        <br>
        it crushes me. daily.
        <br>
        but... i do sometimes remember:
        <br>
        i love what i do. i do. i do. i do. i do. i do.
        <br>
        and i am not going to give up like that. never, ever.
